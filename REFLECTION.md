# Reflection

1. **What was the hardest part to understand?**

   - The hardest part to understand was using object prototypes instead of a class in JavaScript.

2. **How does this code use `this` to tie data and behavior together?**

   - This code uses `this` to refer to an instance of the playlist object.

3. **What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?**
   - I would use classes for better readability and structure.
